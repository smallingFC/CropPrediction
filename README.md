# CropPrediction
to predict crops using arduino uno and sensors combined with machine learning


Temperature and Humidity sensor, soil pH meter sensor and soil moisture sensor used to find accurate weather and soil conditions local to the area as temp and humidity provided by online websites and MET departments are for a much larger area and there can be differences in regions. After collecting data from these sensors, plug the values in the code and get the output which will be the most suitable crop to be grown. 

Used decision trees regressor to predict the output and trained the model on a dataset provided by Kaggle.
